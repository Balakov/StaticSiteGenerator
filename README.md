# StaticSiteGenerator
A simple static site generator that has just enough features to make my own websites. Jekyll and Hugo were too hard.

Really a test project to try out .NET 5, but turned out to be quite useful. Uses a Kestrel webserver and FileWatchers to to live monitoring and file serving. The syntax contains elements of Hugo and Jekyll, and I will document it all at some point.
